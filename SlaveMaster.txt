- Reports back to the master a valid response (data? data)
- Slave wait for a command; master continue to send the next command

Master:
- Sends a command (with params) to a slave by its id
- May post more commands to the same/other slaves
- Process incoming reponses
- Store responses' results

Master: dont know what is task (stracture), only sends a <taskid, slaveid, data>
